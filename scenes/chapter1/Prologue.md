# Chapter 1 - The Storm

*huff* *huff* *huff*
I finally see Arylis in sight. I run to her, not knowing who is nearby.

"How... how did this happen?" she says. "How did it come to this?"
Not knowing anything to say to her to comfort her, I wrap my arms around her.

She looked up. "This is all my fault. All of this happened because I just couldn't use that power!"
I silently shake my head no.

"This happened because we didn't prepare. We didn't think Vessa would just possess the Hogoshas, much less the Kemonos," I state.

Out of nowhere, I see a Hogosha come close. It spun its head around, before it saw us.

"Iroas! Go! I'll be fine!" Arylis cries.

"No."

I stand up, shakily, rusted sword in hand. The Hogosha's gun targets me.

"Iroas!" Arylis yells.
Out of nowhere, Arylis holds out her hand and a glowing yellow nine-tailed fox rushes into the Hogosha, destroying it.

I lay down, exhausted. Arylis catches me and runs as fast as she can. She opens a door and gently places me into a chamber.
"See you soon..." she whispers. She walks away.
