# Chapter 1 - The Storm

__**200 years ago**__

\*huff\* \*huff\* \*huff\*
I finally see Arylis in sight. I run to her, not knowing who is nearby.

"How... how did this happen?" she asks. "How did it come to this?"
Not knowing anything to say to her to comfort her, I wrap my arms around her.

She looked up. "This is all my fault. All of this happened because I just couldn't use that power!"
I silently shake my head no.

"This happened because we didn't prepare. We didn't think Vessoka would just turn the Hogoshas on us, much less the Kemonos," I sadly say. "You couldn't do anything - you couldn't harness Lux' power."

Out of nowhere, I see a Hogosha come close. It spun its head around, before it spotted us.

"Iroas! Go! I'll be fine!" Arylis cries.

"No."

I stand up, shakily, rusted sword in hand. The Hogosha's gun targets me.

"Iroas!" Arylis yells.

Out of nowhere, Arylis shoots out her hand and a young girl surrounded by three golden flames rushes out of a rift marked with the symbol of light.

*She was Lux, the sixth mage of Koralue.*

She stabs a glowing sword into the Hogosha, destroying it, before disappearing into a spirit, dashing into the sky.

I fall down, exhausted. Arylis catches me, picks me up, and runs as fast as she can. She opens a door and gently places me into a chamber.

"See you soon..." she whispers. She walks away.

The last thing I see is a yellow spirit flying into to me, before I fell asleep.
